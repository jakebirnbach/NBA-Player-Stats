Compares stats of NBA players from differet eras to determine which is the better player

The question that prompted this program was, “Who is better at basketball, Michael Jordan or Lebron James”, an often disputed topic among basketball analysts. Since Jordan and Lebron played during different time periods, it is very difficult to determine who is better. This program attempts to answer this question using statistics. In the attatched video, the program calculates and compares Jordan and Lebron’s career average points per game with the mean points per game of all players during the era in which the specified player played in. Jordan is compared with players from 1985 to 2003 and Lebron is compared with players from 2004 to 2021. The program then uses these statistics and parameters to calculate the z-score for each player. The player with the higher z-score is the better player for the specified stat type. The program also produces graphical outputs that show where each player’s career average lies on the normal distribution of all players that played during their career.
